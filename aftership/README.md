# AfterShip App for Gladly Sidekick

The AfterShip app for Gladly Sidekick provides detailed tracking information for packages, allowing customers to monitor shipments, get information about exceptions, and resolve WISMO (Where Is My Order) queries.

## Benefits

**Empower Customer Self-Service & Reduce WISMO Inquiries**
Allow customers to proactively track their shipments and receive updates on exceptions directly through Gladly Sidekick. This reduces "Where Is My Order?" (WISMO) inquiries, freeing up agent time for more complex issues.

**24/7 Accessibility for Customers**
Customers can access shipment tracking information anytime, anywhere via Sidekick, without needing to wait for an agent, leading to a more convenient and immediate self-service experience.

## Example Use Cases

- A customer uses Gladly Sidekick to check the status of their recent order. They enter their tracking number and Sidekick displays the latest shipment updates from AfterShip, including the current location and estimated delivery date.
- A customer reports via Sidekick that their package tracking shows "Delivered," but they haven't received it. Sidekick can present the detailed delivery information (e.g., signed by, left at front door)

## Available Actions

The AfterShip app supports the following management actions:

- **Create Tracking**  
  Creates a tracking item in AfterShip for a given tracking number. This is necessary because AfterShip does not automatically track orders. This action can optionally associate the tracking with an `order_id` and `order_number` in your system.  
  _Note: The language used in tracking links generated by AfterShip may default to US English or be based on the destination country/region._

- **Lookup by Tracking Number**  
  Retrieves detailed tracking information for a shipment using its tracking number.

## Data Pulls

The AfterShip app is action-oriented and does not feature traditional, automatic Data Pulls that populate customer profiles before an interaction. Instead, it empowers both customers with on-demand access to rich tracking information.

# AfterShip App Toolkit

## Who maintains the integration

The AfterShip integration is built and maintained by Gladly.

## How the integration works

The AfterShip App integrates with the AfterShip platform via its [AfterShip Tracking API](https://www.aftership.com/docs/tracking/quickstart/api-quick-start). This allows Gladly to perform queries (like retrieving tracking information) and mutations (like creating a tracking entry). You can find out more about AfterShip's APIs at [https://www.aftership.com/docs/tracking/quickstart/api-quick-start](https://www.aftership.com/docs/tracking/quickstart/api-quick-start).
To verify which version of the API is used check actions' individual `request_url.gtpl` files.
AfterShip supports tracking for hundreds of couriers. You can find the [current list of supported couriers here](https://www.aftership.com/docs/tracking/others/supported-couriers).

_Important Note on Courier Tracking Links:_ The AfterShip API provides tracking URL information that this app surfaces. There appear to be multiple fields within the AfterShip API response for courier tracking links. While the app aims to use the most relevant one, a specific field (`courier_tracking_link` with a detailed description regarding language parameters) is prioritized. If you encounter issues with tracking links, it's advisable to check the raw data returned by AfterShip or consult AfterShip's documentation for the most up-to-date information on their API fields.

Authentication is handled via an API Token included in the request headers.

## Setup & Installation

### Before You Start

You will need an API Token from AfterShip.

### Installation

To obtain the API Token, refer to the [AfterShip documentation](https://www.aftership.com/docs/tracking/quickstart/authentication#how-to-get-your-api-key). The API key should be configured in Gladly when setting up the AfterShip app. Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions to create and read trackings.

## AfterShip Custom App
