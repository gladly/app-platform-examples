## Who maintains the integration

The Gladly APIs for App Platform integration is built and maintained by Gladly.

## How the integration works

This app integrates with Gladly via its REST API ([API documentation](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/)). Actions are performed by making authenticated HTTP requests to Gladly endpoints. Authentication is handled via API tokens included in the request headers.

## Setup & Installation

### Before You Start

You will need:
- A Gladly API Token with permissions to perform the desired actions. This can be generated from within the Gladly UI by an Administrator or API User, under Settings > App Developer Tools.

### Installation

1. Obtain your Gladly API Token
2. When creating a new configuration, provide the following objects:

#### Configuration Object

The configuration object includes any non-sensitive settings required for the app, such as the username or other integration parameters.

Example:
```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "username": "your-gladly-username",
    "gladlyHost": "your-domain.us-1.gladly.com"
  }
}
```

#### Secrets Object

The secrets object should include sensitive credentials, such as your Gladly API Token.

Example:
```json
{
  "secrets": {
    "apiToken": "YOUR_GLADLY_API_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

These objects are used to generate authentication headers for all REST requests made by the app.
